"""
Quality filter post-processor.

Order 20 — runs last. Filters out low-quality results based on:
- Minimum relevance score
- Minimum content length

Equivalent to CAgent's QualityFilterPostProcessor.

Safety: if all chunks are filtered out, keeps the single best chunk
to avoid returning empty results (configurable).
