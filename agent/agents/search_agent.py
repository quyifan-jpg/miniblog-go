"""
Search agent tool — called by the main Agno orchestrator in celery_tasks.py.

Previously: created an Agno Agent with 10 tools and called .run().
            The LLM chose tools implicitly through OpenAI function-calling with
            no visible reasoning chain.

Now: delegates to graph.search_scrape_graph.run_search_pipeline() which runs a
     LangGraph ReAct agent (langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent).

     Explicit Thought / Action / Observation loop:
       ┌─ Thought  ─ LLM decides which tool to call
       ├─ Action   ─ tool is invoked (search_chunks, search_google_news, …)
       ├─ Observation ─ tool result fed back to LLM
       └─ … repeat until the agent is satisfied …
       └─ Format   ─ response_format step coerces output into SearchResults

     The full chain is printed to stdout, making the agent's reasoning
     fully observable without external tooling.

External API (used by celery_tasks.py):
  search_agent_run(agent, query) → str   ← unchanged

Re-exported models (kept here for backward-compat imports in other modules):
  ReturnItem, SearchResults

    Agno tool: search for high-quality, diverse sources about the given topic.

    Internally runs a LangGraph ReAct loop with 10 project search tools.
    Results are saved into the shared session state so that subsequent tools
    (scrape_agent_run, podcast_script_agent_run, …) can access them.

    Args:
        agent: Agno Agent instance — provides agent.session_id.
        query: The search intent / topic (may contain typos; intent is inferred).

    Returns:
        Human-readable status string consumed by the main orchestrator as an
        Observation in its own (Agno) tool-calling loop.
